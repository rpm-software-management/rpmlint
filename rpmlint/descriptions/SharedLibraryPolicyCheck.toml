shlib-policy-nonversioned-dir="""
Your shared library package contains non-versioned directories. Those will not
allow to install multiple versions of the package in parallel.
"""
shlib-policy-excessive-dependency="""
Your package starts with 'lib' as part of its name, but also contains binaries
that have more dependencies than those that already required by the libraries.
Those binaries should probably not be part of the library package, but split into
a seperate one to reduce the additional dependencies for other users of this library.
"""
shlib-policy-missing-lib="""
Your package name looks its based on soname, but does not provide any libraries.
"""
shlib-fixed-dependency="""
Your shared library package requires a fixed version of another package. The
intention of the Shared Library Policy is to allow parallel installation of
multiple versions of the same shared library, hard dependencies likely make that
impossible. Please remove this dependency and instead move it to the runtime uses
of your library.
"""
shlib-unversioned-lib="""
Your package matches the Shared Library Policy Naming Scheme but contains an
unversioned library. Therefore it is very unlikely that your package can be installed
in parallel to another version of this library package. Consider moving unversioned
parts into another package.
