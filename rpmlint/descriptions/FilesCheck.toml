The file is setgid. Usually this is a packaging bug. If this is a game,
then, you should use the proper rpm group, or location.
"""
non-standard-executable-perm="""
A standard executable should have permission set to 0755. If you get this
message, it means that you have a wrong executable permissions in some files
included in your package.

sourced-script-with-shebang="""
This text file contains a shebang, but is meant to be sourced, not
executed.
"""
executable-sourced-script="""
This text file has executable bit set, but is meant to be sourced, not
executed.
"""
wrong-script-interpreter="""
This script uses an interpreter which is either an inappropriate one
or located in an inappropriate directory for packaged system software.

Alternatively, if the file should not be executed, then ensure that
it is not marked as executable.
"""
env-script-interpreter="""
This script uses 'env' as an interpreter.
For the rpm runtime dependency detection to work, the shebang
#!/usr/bin/env <interpreter>

needs to be patched into
#!/usr/bin/<interpreter>

otherwise the package dependency generator merely adds a dependency
on /usr/bin/env rather than the actual interpreter /usr/bin/<interpreter>.

Alternatively, if the file should not be executed, then ensure that
it is not marked as executable or don't install it in a path that
is reserved for executables.
"""
non-executable-script="""
This text file contains a shebang or is located in a path dedicated for
executables, but lacks the executable bits and cannot thus be executed. If
the file is meant to be an executable script, add the executable bits,
otherwise remove the shebang or move the file elsewhere.

This text file has executable bits set or is located in a path dedicated
for executables, but lacks a shebang and cannot thus be executed. If the file
is meant to be an executable script, add the shebang, otherwise remove the
executable bits or move the file elsewhere.

Rename it.
"""
file-in-meta-package="""
This package seems to be a meta-package (an empty package used to require
other packages), but it is not empty. You should remove or rename it, see the
option MetaPackageRegexp.
"""
empty-debuginfo-package="""
This debuginfo package contains no files. This is often a sign of binaries
being unexpectedly stripped too early during the build, rpmbuild not being able
to strip the binaries, the package actually being a noarch one but erratically
packaged as arch dependent, or something else. Verify what the case is, and
if there's no way to produce useful debuginfo out of it, disable creation of
the debuginfo package.
"""
debuginfo-without-sources="""
This debuginfo package appears to contain debug symbols but no source files.
This is often a sign of binaries being unexpectedly stripped too early during
the build, or being compiled without compiler debug flags (which again often
is a sign of distro's default compiler flags ignored which might have security
consequences), or other compiler flags which result in rpmbuild's debuginfo
extraction not working as expected. Verify that the binaries are not
unexpectedly stripped and that the intended compiler flags are used.
"""
missing-dependency-to-crontabs="""
This package installs a file in /etc/cron.*/ but
doesn't require crontabs to be installed. As crontabs is not part of the essential packages,
your package should explicitely require crontabs to make sure that your cron job is
executed. If it is an optional feature of your package, recommend or suggest crontabs.
"""
missing-dependency-to-logrotate="""
This package installs a file in /etc/logrotate.d/ but
doesn't require logrotate to be installed. Because logrotate is not part of the essential packages,
your package should explicitely depend on logrotate to make sure that your logrotate
job is executed. If it is an optional feature of your package, recommend or suggest logrotate.
"""
missing-dependency-to-xinetd="""
This package installs a file in /etc/xinetd.d/ but
doesn't require xinetd to be installed. Because xinetd is not part of the essential packages,
your package should explicitely depend on logrotate to make sure that your xinetd
job is executed. If it is an optional feature of your package, recommend or suggest xinetd.
"""
read-error="""
This file could not be read. A reason for this could be that the info about
it in the rpm header indicates that it is supposed to be a readable normal file
but it actually is not in the filesystem. Because of this, some checks will
be skipped.
"""
inaccessible-filename="""
An error occurred while trying to access this file due to some characters
in its name. Because of this, some checks will be skipped. Access could work
with some other locale settings.

This crontab file is a symbolic link, which is insecure and refused by newer
version of cron
"""
rpath-in-buildconfig="""
This build configuration file contains rpaths which will be introduced into
dependent packages.
"""
python-bytecode-wrong-magic-value="""
The 'magic' ABI version embedded in this python bytecode file isn't equal
to that of the corresponding runtime, which will force the interpreter to
recompile the .py source every time, ignoring the saved bytecode.
"""
python-bytecode-inconsistent-mtime="""
The timestamp embedded in this python bytecode file isn't equal to the mtime
of the original source file, which will force the interpreter to recompile the
.py source every time, ignoring the saved bytecode.
"""
python-bytecode-without-source="""
This python bytecode file (.pyo/.pyc) is not accompanied by its original
source file (.py)
"""
duplicate-executable="""
This executable file exists in more than one standard binary directories.
It can cause problems when dirs in $PATH are reordered.
"""
no-manual-page-for-binary="""
Each executable in standard binary directories should have a man page.

manual-page-warning="""
This man page may contain problems that can cause it not to be formatted
as intended.

incorrect-fsf-address="""
The Free Software Foundation address in this file seems to be outdated or
misspelled. Ask upstream to update the address, or if this is a license file,
possibly the entire file with a new copy available from the FSF.
"""
gzipped-svg-icon="""
Not all desktop environments that support SVG icons support them gzipped
(.svgz). Install the icon as plain uncompressed SVG.
"""
pem-certificate="""
Shipping a PEM certificate is likely wrong. If used for the default
configuration, this is insecure ( since the certificate is public ). If this
is used for validation, ie a CA certificate store, then this must be kept up
to date due to CA compromise. The only valid reason is for testing purpose,
so ignore this warning if this is the case.
"""
pem-private-key="""
Private key in a .pem file should not be shipped in a rpm, unless
this is for testing purpose ( ie, run by the test suite ). Shipping it
as part of the example documentation mean that someone will sooner or later
use it and setup a insecure configuration.
"""
tcl-extension-file="""
Script libraries for Tcl extensions should be in a package-specific
subdir of /usr/share/tcl.
"""
makefile-junk="""
Your package contains makefiles that only make sense in a
source package. Did you package a complete directory from the
tarball by using %doc? Consider removing Makefile* from this
directory at the end of your %install section to reduce bloat.
